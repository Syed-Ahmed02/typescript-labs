I have an interview coming up and I need to practice my TypeScript debugging skills. Create a simple react project called lab3. In it, put four bugs, and it should be able to be solved within a 30-minute timeframe. Also create a checklist.md file with the answers so that an AI agent can check if I did it correctly. I will prompt you later. use different concepts then the ones mentioned in concepts.md
